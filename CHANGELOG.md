# v1.0.1 (Jan. 03, 2025)

- Added a "No results found" text when pagefind doesn't find any results
- Added [simple icons](https://simpleicons.org) since Lucide is phasing out brand icons
- Fixed a bug where the (development-only) mock-endpoint for pagefind would error out due to an invalid mime-type
